I am deeply passionate about AI Engineering, with specialized expertise in Knowledge Graphs, AI Agents, and Large Language Models (LLMs). My abilities center on harnessing these advanced technologies to address complex challenges and foster innovation, blending theoretical insights with practical applications to drive impactful solutions.

Professionally, I serve as a **Business Intelligence Analyst** at an international trading company, where I leverage data science to optimize business operations. My responsibilities include analyzing company performance, developing and enhancing CRM systems, and managing ETL processes to streamline data migration. By evaluating business processes and KPIs, integrating AI capabilities for automation and insights, and designing interactive dashboards for real-time tracking, I support data-driven decision-making and contribute to the companyâ€™s mission of expanding global trade with efficiency and transparency.

Academically, I hold a **Master of Science in Data Science** from the [Tehran institute for advanced studies (TeIAS)](https://teias.institute/computer-science-department/), where I had the privilege of working under the supervision of Dr. Hossein Hojjat. My thesis, **FPSDN: Fault Prediction in Software-Defined Networks**, introduced a pioneering tool for proactive fault detection in SDNs. Leveraging the DyNetKAT framework, I developed FPSDN to analyze OpenFlow logs and predict network faults, achieving a 98.43% reduction in packet volume during preprocessing while enhancing network reliability and security. 
Also, I have extensive experience with **Active Model Learning** algorithms, notably L* and TTT algorithms. These algorithms offer systematic methodologies for inferring models from systems based on observed behaviors. Through my work, I've delved into their applications, understanding their strengths, and potential limitations.
Additionally, I earned a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** from [Sharif University of Technology](http://ce.sharif.edu/), majoring in Computer Engineering, which laid a robust foundation for my technical pursuits.


My interests generally lie in the areas of **AI Engineering**, **Knowledge Graphs**, **LLMs**, and **AI Agents**.

<!-- Getting started
================================================================================
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
-------------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
--
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
